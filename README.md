# Advent of code
This(2024) is the second year i am trying to attempt Advent of code. First year(2023) I tried in Rust and failed miserably. It was a combination of a new language and learning problem solving for the first time together. 

This year I want to focus on problem solving, which is why I am solving it in a language I am comfortable with, C++. I believe this will clear many loopholes in my C++ learning as well. Let's see how it goes :)
